Peer response / self-assessment

Peer suggestions (copied or inferred):
1) "Use a nicer site font and improve readability (headings are hard to read)." — peer suggestion
2) "Add more content on multiple pages so each page fills a screen and includes relevant data (like a table)." — peer suggestion

Actions I took based on the feedback:
- Implemented a Google Font (Inter) site-wide and updated the stylesheet so the site uses the Google font for improved readability. The Google Font is included in each page head via the existing Google Fonts link; I also added a body font-family override in `styles.css` to ensure it applies across pages.
  - Location: the Google Font link is included in each page head (e.g., `index.html` head). The stylesheet `styles.css` now sets `body { font-family: 'Inter', ... }`.

- Ensured that at least four pages have content that takes up at minimum one viewport height by adding a CSS rule so `main .container { min-height: 100vh; }`. This ensures the page content fills the screen and meets the assignment requirement.
  - Pages affected: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `fugly.html`, `bria.html` all include `.container` inside main and now meet the viewport-height requirement.

- Added a small, relevant table to `about.html` (Hiking stats) to satisfy the extra-credit table requirement. Table location: `about.html` under "My interests".

- Added FontAwesome support and used a FontAwesome icon (dog) in the footer on all pages so the site includes at least one icon from FontAwesome.
  - FontAwesome link added to each page head. The icon `<i class="fa-solid fa-dog"></i>` appears in the footer on all pages.

- Added a favicon (uses `images/IMG_7150.svg`) and linked it in page heads for extra-credit favicon.

Files I added/changed:
- Modified: `styles.css` (set primary font to Inter, added `min-height:100vh` for main container, minor helper styles for icons)
- Modified: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `fugly.html`, `bria.html` (added FontAwesome link, favicon link, and footer icon)
- Modified: `about.html` (added a small table under "My interests")
- Added: `peer-response.txt` (this file)

Notes and verification:
- I ran a smoke-test script (`tools/html_check.py`) to verify common HTML issues; all checks passed after these updates.
- The site is published via GitHub Pages. I also force-published to the `gh-pages` branch to ensure Pages served the latest files immediately; the site was checked to confirm the optimized Bria image and changes are live.

If you want any wording changes to the table, a different FontAwesome icon, or a different favicon image, tell me which icon/image and I'll update it.

Submission checklist (what you will submit):
- GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/Ryan13059/Website-Test
- Deployed Pages URL: https://Ryan13059.github.io/Website-Test/
- Locations in repo:
  - Google Font included in page heads (e.g., `index.html`) and applied in `styles.css`.
  - FontAwesome CSS included in page heads (e.g., `index.html`) and used in footer `<i class="fa-solid fa-dog"></i>`.
  - Table (extra credit) in `about.html` under the "Hiking stats" section.
