Peer response / self-assessment

Peer suggestions 
1) "Hello Ryan,

For things I like, I really like the color gradient you used on the pages. I also really liked your contact page.

For advice on your website, the uneven boxes on the about page might be distracting for some users, so straightening them and making them uniform would help prevent that.

The bright white background can become a bit straining on the eyes after a while, so changing it to a softer color could be a nice change for the user experience.

Lastly, this one might be more subjective, as I have a larger monitor, but the text size on the website is a bit on the small side. Increasing the size of the text may help with readability.

2) Hey Ryan, nice job on your website. The website's color palette is really nice. It's calming but keeps your attention. It's a really cool little animation when you hover above some of the boxes in your about page, how they straighten up. The contact section is cool too. I haven't seen anyone else do that.

For possible changes:

1. It feels like there's a lot of blank space on the page. Maybe adding some more stuff (I see an "under construction" label) would help it look fuller and finished. Even the picture of your dog is pretty small, and who doesn't want to see more of Brita?? 
2. A lot of the text is tiny and hard to read. Maybe making it bigger would make it more legible, as well as fill out a little more of the space.

3. I mentioned above how I really liked the animation in the "about" section of the tilted boxes that turn straight, but it's only some of them. Maybe it's just me, but I would love it if they were uniformed (in a way)
and all when going from tilted to straight.
3) Hello Ryan, nice work on your website! Love the animations when hovering over the text boxes in the About section of your site. I also enjoy the contact page; you're giving me ideas for my own website! (Cute dog!)

Some Possible Changes:
The page has a lot of blank space on the sides of the page(s). You could add a border around the text and pictures on the page to fill in the blank spaces.

Some text is small and could be hard to read, but that also might be because I have a large monitor. Increasing the text size wouldn't hurt much. Also, the images are small, but once again, it could be because of my large monitor.

The tilted text boxes on the About page are great, but I don't know if it's on purpose, but some boxes are tilted up, down, or already in the middle. If they were all uniform and then tilted whatever way you felt when you hovered over them, I think it might look a little better. (It could possibly be this style sheet.) image.png 


Notes: 
1) Increased font size 
2) Fixed the boxes 
3) Increased the size of Bria's photos- will add more tomorrow.
