      <!-- Bria bio paragraph added per user request -->
      <p>This is Bria. She's 12 years old, and she loves walking on trails still. While she's slowing down a bit in her older age, she's still eager for adventures and more than willing to receive pets and tummy rubs. Bria is a Guide Dog Career Change, which means she didn't completely pass the program, but she still helps train guide dog puppies at club meetings and assists in training the trainers as well. Bria loves visiting trails, her morning treat routine, and she loves car rides where she can stick her head out the window and take in fresh air (she protects her eyes with the mirror). In her older age, she's not afraid to say when she's done with a walk, or when she would like to go for a walk.</p>
