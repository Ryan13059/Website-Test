  <p>My name is Ryan. I'm a full time student at Olympic College, and I'm currently working part time during this quarter. I enjoy hiking with my dog Bria, gaming when I have time, and trying out new cooking recipes.</p>

  <!-- Meet Bria: short personal note about the dog -->
  <p>Bria enjoys walks at Sehmel Homestead Park which offers hills, great sniffs, and non rocky walkways for her feet. Seeing her happy after a nature bath still makes my day. While her pace is slower now in her older years, she still loves every hike we go on, despite her pace. She always lets me know whenever she's done with her walk and wants to go back to the car. Some days are 1 mile walks, while others go as far as 2 miles at 23 minute a mile paces. She is currently visiting a "dog physical therapist" in order to keep her joints healthy and maintain her mobility. </p>

<p>I got Bria at the age of 2 at Guide Dogs for the Blind in California as a career change puppy. In other words, she didn't quite make the program. Bria has loved her adventures in her earlier years throughout California, and her adventures in Washington. In her younger years, she's worked as a Guide Dog Ambassador, and as a therapy dog visiting retirement homes and hospitals. She loves being active- even in her older years and loves visiting the trails. </p>
